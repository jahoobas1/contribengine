## Architect your game modularly
Contribengine is a game backend designed for modularity.

Contribengine is designed to follow a "lego set" architecture, where the core of the systems is named the Baseplate and each module is called a Brick.

In Contribengine, all code is meant to be underneath this Brick system, while also making it easier to not need to use requires to use every other module, and avoid things like recursive requires.

Another feature of Contribengine is the extensive core library, intended to abstract commonly used Roblox features to make it quicker and easier to make it to the production phase of your game.

## Why Contribengine?
Contribengine boasts a powerful community based approach to development.

Contribengine is completely open-sourced, and many modules are to be designed by the community.

It is meant to be easy to expand.

## How?
Well, the project is still very early in development. Thus, I feel that it's not properly ready for a tutorial on how to get it set up (especially since it may change).
